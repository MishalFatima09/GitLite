# GitLite üß©

**GitLite** is a simplified version of Git built as a C++ console application. It mimics core version control functionalities like tracking file changes, adding to staging, committing, and logging history ‚Äî helping users understand how Git works internally.

This project was created as part of an academic assignment to implement the logic behind version control systems using file handling and basic data structures.

## ‚ú® Features

- Track changes to files
- Add files to a staging area
- Commit changes with messages
- View commit history
- Simulate Git-like CLI commands (basic subset)

## üõ† Tech Stack

- File I/O (`fstream`)
- STL (`map`, `vector`, `string`, etc.)
- Command Line Interface
